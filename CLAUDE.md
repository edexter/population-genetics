# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains teaching materials for a 4-week population genetics module, part of a semester-long masters level course in evolutionary genetics at the University of Basel. The module is split 50/50 between:
- **Bioinformatics**: Practical skills for genomic data analysis
- **Population genetics theory**: Theoretical foundations complementing the practical work

## Audience

- Masters students in evolutionary genetics
- Variable technical backgrounds
- May have limited Linux/programming experience
- Need practical skills to complement theoretical knowledge

## Repository Contents

The repository will contain:
- PowerPoint presentations for lectures
- Lecture notes and reference materials
- Analysis scripts (Python, R, bash)
- Example datasets for hands-on exercises
- Linux tutorials and command references (e.g., [Linux_cookbook.md](Linux_cookbook.md))

## Voice and Style

**CRITICAL**: All content must be written in the instructor's voice, NOT Claude's voice. Students will read these materials directly.

- Write as the course instructor speaking directly to students
- Be clear and pedagogical but not condescending
- Balance rigor with accessibility
- Include practical bioinformatics context and real-world applications
- Use examples relevant to population genetics and evolutionary biology
- Be direct about what students need to memorize vs. what they can look up

## Content Guidelines

When creating or editing materials:

1. **Code and scripts**: Comment thoroughly, assuming students are still learning
2. **Documentation**: Explain *why* things work, not just *how* to use them
3. **Examples**: Use population genetics contexts (allele frequencies, FST, genetic diversity, etc.)
4. **File organization**: Keep structure clear and intuitive for students to navigate
5. **Practical emphasis**: Connect theoretical concepts to computational implementation

## Course Context

- This is one module within a larger evolutionary genetics course taught by multiple professors
- Students need to integrate this material with content from other modules
- Final examination will test both theoretical understanding and practical skills
- Students should be able to apply bioinformatics skills to population genetic problems
