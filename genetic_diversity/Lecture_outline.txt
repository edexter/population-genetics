Introduction (5 min)

Why measure genetic diversity? (Evolution, conservation, health)
Overview of what we'll calculate today
Introduce the example dataset: 5 sequences, 10 bases aligned

1. Number of Segregating Sites (S) (10 min)

Definition: Count of polymorphic (variable) positions in the alignment
Hand calculation:

Show the 5×10 alignment
Identify which sites are variable
Count them


Interpretation: Raw measure of variation, sample-size dependent
Typical values: Depends on organism, region, sample size

2. Nucleotide Diversity (π) (15 min)

Definition: Average pairwise differences per site between sequences
Formula: π = (sum of pairwise differences) / (number of comparisons × sequence length)
Hand calculation:

Calculate all pairwise comparisons (5 choose 2 = 10 pairs)
Count differences for each pair
Sum and divide by (10 pairs × 10 sites)


Interpretation: Per-site diversity, accounts for allele frequencies
Typical values: Often 0.001-0.01 in many organisms

3. Heterozygosity (He) (15 min)

Definition: Expected heterozygosity (gene diversity) at each site
Formula: He = 1 - Σ(pi²), where pi = frequency of allele i
Hand calculation:

For each variable site, calculate allele frequencies
Apply formula
Average across all sites (or just variable sites)


Interpretation: Probability two random alleles differ
Connection: Related to π but calculated per-site then averaged

4. Watterson's Theta (θw) (12 min)

Definition: Estimate of population mutation parameter based on S
Formula: θw = S / an, where an = Σ(1/i) for i=1 to n-1 (harmonic number)
Why we need it: Corrects for sample size bias in S
Hand calculation:

Calculate harmonic number for n=5: an = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Divide S by an


Interpretation: Another estimator of θ = 4Neμ
Typical values: Similar scale to π

5. Relationships Between Statistics (8 min)

Compare π vs θw:

Both estimate θ = 4Neμ
π weights by allele frequency; θw treats all mutations equally
When π > θw: excess of intermediate-frequency variants
When π < θw: excess of rare variants


Mention Tajima's D (conceptually only):

Standardized difference between π and θw
Indicator of selection or demographic history
Don't calculate, but understand what difference means


Connect to He: Related to π, both frequency-weighted

Summary (5 min)

Recap: Four main statistics and what they measure
When to use which statistic
Preview of practical: calculating these on real data with bioinformatic tools
Key takeaway: Different statistics capture different aspects of diversity
